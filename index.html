Our school canteen is very well equipped. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students. All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us. I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Most states require teachers to pass a comprehensive series of assessments to obtain certification within a specific subject area. With this requirement, you would think that all teachers would be proficient enough to teach the subject area(s) they were hired to teach. Unfortunately, there are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. This is an area that could be overcome through preparation. All teachers should thoroughly prepare for any lesson before they teach it to make sure they understand what they are going to be teaching. Teachers will lose credibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching, thus making them ineffective.</p>
